# 2024 Financial Services Autism Hackathon - Main Site

The main repository for the 2024 hackathon with all the information for the hackathon and pointers to all repositories. Hackathon informaton pertaining to 2024 specifically will remain in here. The individual repositories are made to span multiple years. This years hackathon will continue to focus on ensuring the growth for each use case. This means the repositories created this year will be use again in subsequent years provided these use cases are repeated again. We need to ensure these solutions will lead to real world outcomes.

## Mission Statement
Bring developers from the Financial Services industry together to demonstrate how innovative Microsoft technologies can transform autism services by tackling real world use cases provided by families and creating lasting open-source projects for the community.

## Use cases

### Use case 1: Therapy session co-pilot
#### Objective: Assist the RBT and BCBA during a session with the child
RBT (Reisterd Behavioral Technician) implements a session designed by the BCBA and looks to acomplish the goals and targets set by the BCBA. Usually, they carry an IPAD or an IoT device to capture their observations. But this has two challenges - it splits the focus of the RBT between focusing on the child and capturing the observations; and it is a very one-dimnesional approach to capture the observations. This use case attempts to solve these challenges by providing  multi-sensory approach to data capture.
#### Scenario
The session will comprise of:
* Multi-modal data capture
  * A smartphone app used by RBT - similar to what some RBTs have today
  * Video camera to record the session - this will focus on capturing facial expressions, body language, fluency of tasks, etc.
  * Microphone - this will focus on cpaturing voice, tone, etc. to determine emotions
* Real-time identification of pre-designed triggers
  * This moule will specifically look for pre-designed triggers - emoitonal (frustration, accomplishment, etc.), or physical (completion of task, eye contact, etc.)
  * The objective here to track progress along specific markers
* Post-session summarization
  * Summarize and generate notes - free form based on observations across all modes
  * Summarize progress on specific markers
#### Stakeholders
* Key stakeholder: RBT
* Other stakeholders: BCBA, parents, children

### Use case 2: Program development design co-pilot
#### Objective: Assist the BCBA design a program specifically tailored for each child
A BCBA (Board Certified Behavior Analyst) designs a program specifically for each child based on individualized treatment plan. It will center around the activitie the child enjoys and responds to. The objective is to have specific tasks for the child to complete with a certain level of fluency. This needs to take into account previous assessments, observations, and progress markers. 
#### Scenario
* The co-pilot will be able to ingest past program summaries in multi-modal form - videos, notes (digitized and undigitized), voide recordings, etc
* Based on these, the co-pilot will place the child in a cohort of other children with similar assessments and markers
* Based on past successes of children in the cohort, the co-pilot will suggest a recalibrated treatment and markers (if needed) to the BCBA
* It can generate a progress summary at any given point of time
#### Stakeholders
* Key stakeholder: BCBA
* Other stakeholders: RBTs, parents, children

### Use case 3: Client on-boarding co-pilot
#### Objective: Help BCBA onboard a new patient quickly
Typically, a BCBA gets limited amount of time to onboard a new patient and this can be a very cumbersome task. It includes several types of information to intake:
* Patient demographics, medical history, past services, etc.
* Historical evaluations, IEPs, etc.
* Insurance, funding, billing information, etc.
* Previous and current treatments and their outcomes, progress reports, etc.
* Consent forms, contracts, letter of engagement, etc.
#### Scenario
* The co-pilot will be able to ingest historical documents
* It will allow parents, BCBAs, and RBTs to actively collaborate across sessions - such as allowing parents to provide inputs of progress outside of sessions
* It will allow tracking documents and provide a platform for storing consents, authorizations, etc.
* It can generate a summarization of the new client for the BCBA to review
#### Stakeholders
* Key stakeholder: BCBA
* Other stakeholders: Parents, children

### Use case 4: Friendly neighborhood Mobile Networking App
#### Objective: Connect parents of children with ASD with helpful resources in the community - other parents, BCBAs, organizations, etc.
When parents move into a new neighborhood, they are not sure what local resources are available to help them or their child. They don't know which RBT, BCBA, or ABA therapist will be best suited for their child. Often times, parents don't even know what questions to ask or what benefits are available to them. This app attempts to start solving the problem.
#### Scenario
This mobile app will help connect parents and patients with other helpful members of the community - other parents, BCBAs, organizations, etc. It will work in three main phases
* Intake
  * Allow patients and parents to fill in their and thier child's profile
  * Offer a helpful "onbording survey" that will gather basic information about their child
* Discover
  * Use ChatGPT to allow parents and patients ask open ended questions and have a conversation
  * Prompt the right next actions for the parents 
  * Provide helpful information from credible sources
* Connect
  * Connect them with other parents in same situation
  * Connect them with credible resources and organizations that offer help in the specific area they are looking for
#### Stakeholders
* Key stakeholder: Parents
* Other stakeholders: BCBA, RBTs, Non-profit organizations, children
