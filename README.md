# 2024 Financial Services Autism Hackathon - Main Site

The main repository for the 2024 hackathon with all the information for the hackathon and pointers to all repositories. Hackathon informaton pertaining to 2024 specifically will remain in here. The individual repositories are made to span multiple years. This years hackathon will continue to focus on ensuring the growth for each use case. This means the repositories created this year will be use again in subsequent years provided these use cases are repeated again. We need to ensure these solutions will lead to real world outcomes.

## Mission Statement
Bring developers from the Financial Services industry together to demonstrate how innovative Microsoft technologies can transform autism services by tackling real world use cases provided by families and creating lasting open-source projects for the community.

## Dates and Location
The date of the event is April 3rd and 4th. The event will be hybrid. The in-person venue will be in NYC at the EY Headquarter in 1 Manhattan West during World Autism Awareness Month (April).

## Proposed Use cases
### Theme 1: Ideas ready for adoption in th next 12-18 months
* Participation and collaboration of practitioners, along with parents
#### Use case 1: Therapy session - IOT data collection & video analysis
* Combine use case 1 & 2 from 2023
We can include elments of robotics and computer vision here to capture when certain gestures and expressions occur in a session. Currently, the capture is purely a manual effort. The video can then be run through a recognition algorithm to classify events. 

#### Use case 2: Analytical data from therapy session
* Use case 3 from 2023
* We can add Generative AI to analyze past records, group and cluster students based on progress, performance, etc. and suggest a therapy plan for them
* Auto summarize session notes and take-aways. Summarize past sessions to serve as important reminders on what need to be the focus for an upcoming session or bring a new practitioner up to speed

### Theme 2: Ideas that are more innovative an technology focused
#### Use case 3: Halo lens
Skill based training, but adopting Generative AI along with it

#### Use case 4: Metaverse
Train social interaction through gaming and add Generative AI along with it
